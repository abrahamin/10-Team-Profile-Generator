# 10-Team-Profile-Generator

  ## Description

  This project is a Node.js command-line application that generates an HTML webpage based on information inputs about employees on a software engineering team. Because testing is key in making any code maintainable, unit tests are written for the code in this application. `Inquirer` was used to collect the input from the user and `Jest` was used to run the unit tests.
  
  In order to meet the Acceptance Criteria of the project:

  * prompts for team members and their information will generate an HTML file based on the user input
  * clicking on an email address in the HTML will open the default email program
  * clicking on a GitHub username will open the GitHub profile in a new tab
  * starting the application will prompt the team manager's information
  * a menu with options to add an engineer or an intern or finish building the team is presented after each new member
  * finish building the team will exit the application and generate the HTML
